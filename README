BEARPLOT
========

Started out as a realization that describing a series of functions makes sense
in Haskell, ended up being adjusted to plot streamed data.

Usage
-----

There's examples on its usage in the Makefile.

Currently some of the configuration is still at the source code level, so
don't be a stranger to messing around with it.

In particular, you'll likely want to increase the "cutoff" value in
StreamInput.sh.
